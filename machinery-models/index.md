## Horizontal Band Saw

The horizontal band saw takes a 64 1/2 blade 1/2 x 6-10 teeth. We have bought our last replacement band 11/23/16 at Carbide Saw for $30.

## Vertical Band Saw

This is the vertical band saw blade we'd like to try next time we need a replacement (copy of order, but order was not placed due to shipping costs). Good to combine buying horizontal and vertical blades at same time. Local blade companies don't offer 14/18 but it was recommended as the variable tooth we need for aluminum from Jay Ewing.
